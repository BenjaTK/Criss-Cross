A simple Godot addon that adds generic **grid** nodes for quickly building grid-based systems, in **2D** or **3D**.

# ✨ Nodes

## Grid2D
![A grid inventory system made with the Grid2D node](assets/grid2d.gif)
A grid in the X and Y axis which contains values for each cell. It can be `infinite`, or generate cells with `regions`.\
In the example at `scenes/demos/inventory`, it is used to make an inventory system similar to those found in games like Escape from Tarkov or Kenshi. 


## Grid3D
![A grid-based building system in 3D](assets/grid3d.gif)
A grid in the X and Z axis which contains values for each cell. It can be `infinite`, or generate cells with `regions`.\
In the example at `scenes/demos/building_3d`, it is used to make a ~~(terrible looking)~~ building system.

# ❓ How to use
